        On 16 September 1817, a National School was established by Joseph
        Wilson, in temporary premises in Wheler Street. The following year, the
        Duke of York laid the foundation stone of a permanent school building on
        the south side of Quaker Street.Christchurch School, opened in 1900, was
        the fourth of the seven new elementary schools built by the board, and
        the adjacent higher grade (i.e. senior elementary) school, opened the
        following year, was the first of its kind in the county.

          math competition and got a certifcate along with my other freinds who
          also won it was quite alright but i thought it was going to be more
          challenging and the teacher said "If you don't know times table go on
          TTrockstars."
